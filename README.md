# Keeper

This project is a clone of Googles Kepper web app. I made a clone of the Gooogles Keeper web app to use my knoweldge of React, Hooks and States to create an web app and I was succesfull. The app has the ssame UI as the orignal app. The app lets the user submit a sticky note and it also allows them to delete it just like windows sticky note
